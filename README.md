## Getting Started

On how to run the application, do the following:
- Clone the repository through VS Code (Login using your contributor-approved account)
- Download the Flutter extension in VS Code Extensions
- After a bit of downloading, VS Code will prompt you that you do not have the SDK yet, you may press Download SDK and pick a path for your SDK that you can access easily.
- You may need to add the SDK to your PATH variables. There will be a prompt in VS Code once the SDK has been downloaded to add it to the path.
- If it did not show up, copy the path to your SDK and then paste it in your Path.

- To access admin panel, do "flutter run -d chrome" to open a chrome tab that starts at the admin login screen.
- Use your credentials based on what I've sent to manage questions, banners, badges and avatars.
